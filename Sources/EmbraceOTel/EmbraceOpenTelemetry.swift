 TODO: This file, the protocol and implementation was created for testing purposes.
 Prior to merge this PR (or afterwards) this will be unified with austin API updates.
 When that happens:
 - Delete this file
 - Go to `URLSessionCaptureService` and modify the `init` to be compliant with the protocol that
 `EmbraceOTel` implements.
